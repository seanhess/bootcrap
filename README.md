Bootcrap
========

Prototype web applications without worrying about how they look.

Motivation
----------

CSS Frameworks like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) help you make an application look good more easily. However, it still takes significant effort to make an application look good. Sometimes, that's not what you need.

When prototyping, you are exploring ideas. Sometimes requirements change frequently. Sometimes it doesn't make sense to spend any time making things look good. 

What is Bootcrap?
-----------------

Bootcrap is a set of guidelines to follow, and a simple css skin that will help you avoid the temptation to make things look good while prototyping. Components look ok out of the box, but hopefully crappy enough that you don't worry about it. 

Follow the easy path!

Installation
------------

    bower install bootcrap

Guidelines
----------

- make it look like wireframes
- use vertical layout (not horizontal, no columns)
- never customize the look
- use HTML5 tags

TODO 

- [ ] buttons with icons, font awesome
